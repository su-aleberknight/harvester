Top-level constants/vars/types

    finalizerName
        Purpose: a unique finalizer string added to DummyClusterNetwork objects to block their deletion until the controller has cleaned up cluster-scoped resources (NAD, DaemonSet) and verified no VMs/VMIs are using the network.
        Behavior: controller adds this when a DCN is created and only removes it once cleanup is safe.

    dcnGroup, dcnVersion, dcnKind
        Purpose: constants that define the GVK for the DummyClusterNetwork the controller manages (used to build an unstructured object to watch and to set GroupVersionKind for fetches).

    type DummyClusterNetworkReconciler
        Fields:
            client.Client: controller-runtime client used for all API operations (Get, Create, Update, Delete, List).
            Scheme *runtime.Scheme: used if the controller needs scheme info (not heavily used in this example).
        Purpose: the controller struct that implements the reconciliation logic.

SetupWithManager

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) SetupWithManager(mgr ctrl.Manager) error
    Purpose: register the controller with the controller-runtime manager.
    What it does:
        Configures the controller to "For" an unstructured object with apiVersion network.harvester.io/v1alpha1 and kind DummyClusterNetwork.
        Returns the controller manager configuration, so controller-runtime will call Reconcile for changes to those objects.
    Notes / improvements:
        This uses an unstructured type so the controller doesn't need a generated typed client for the CRD.
        You might want to add Watches for NetworkAttachmentDefinition, DaemonSet, or KubeVirt VM/VMI resources so reconciliations happen when related resources change (current code only reconciles on DCN changes).
        You can add predicates to limit which events trigger reconciliations.

Reconcile

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) Reconcile(ctx context.Context, req ctrl.Request) (ctrl.Result, error)
    Purpose: main reconciliation loop — called when a DummyClusterNetwork changes (create/update/delete). Ensures NAD and DaemonSet exist on create; ensures safe cleanup on deletion.
    Inputs: ctx, ctrl.Request (contains Name for cluster-scoped object)
    Outputs: ctrl.Result (for requeue decisions) and error
    High-level behavior & steps:
        Build an unstructured.Unstructured for the DCN using the known GVK and fetch it with r.Get.
            If not found: object was deleted externally; return (nothing to do).
        Extract spec.bridgeName, spec.nadName, spec.nadNamespace from the DCN using unstructured.NestedString(...) (note: the code ignores found/error returns).
            If any are empty, the controller updates status to "InvalidSpec" and requeues after 30s.
        If DCN is not under deletion (DeletionTimestamp is zero):
            Ensure the finalizer is present (add and r.Update object if missing).
            Call ensureNetworkAttachmentDefinition to create the NAD if missing.
            Call ensureBridgeDaemonSet to create the DaemonSet that ensures the bridge exists on nodes.
            Update status to "Ready".
        If DCN has a deletion timestamp (object is being deleted):
            Compute the NAD full name (namespace/name).
            Call isNetworkInUse to check whether any VirtualMachine or VirtualMachineInstance references the NAD.
                If in use: update status to DeletionBlocked and requeue after 30s.
                If not in use: call deleteBridgeDaemonSet and deleteNAD to remove artifacts, then remove the finalizer and update the DCN so deletion completes.
    Side effects:
        Creates/Deletes NAD and DaemonSet.
        Adds/removes finalizer.
        Updates status subresource.
    Important caveats:
        The code swallows errors from NestedString; malformed objects or type errors will be ignored. Better to check the (found, err) returns and handle them explicitly.
        Reconciliation uses fixed requeue intervals; you may prefer events or watches on VM/VMI resources to wake the reconciler when consumers change.
        The DaemonSet name is fixed ("dummy-bridge-ensure"). If you plan multiple DummyClusterNetwork objects with different bridges, that will conflict — consider naming the DaemonSet per-bridge or encoding the bridge name.
        The controller uses raw deletion of cluster-scoped resources instead of using owner references (NAD is namespaced, DCN is cluster-scoped so ownerRef would not normally work). Finalizer approach is appropriate here, but be careful of orphaned resources if the controller cannot run.

updateStatus

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) updateStatus(ctx context.Context, obj *unstructured.Unstructured, phase, reason string) error
    Purpose: write status.phase and status.reason back to the DummyClusterNetwork status subresource.
    What it does:
        Uses unstructured.SetNestedField to set status to a map containing phase and reason.
        Calls r.Status().Update(ctx, obj) to update the status subresource.
    Caveats:
        If the CRD did not enable the status subresource, Status().Update would fail. In your CRD the status subresource is enabled, so this is fine.
        The function ignores the return value of SetNestedField and doesn't handle potential conflicts; callers typically ignore the returned error but should handle Status().Update errors appropriately.
        It sets a single object as the full status map, overwriting any previously set status fields; for extension you might want to merge fields rather than replace.

ensureNetworkAttachmentDefinition

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) ensureNetworkAttachmentDefinition(ctx context.Context, namespace, name, bridge string) error
    Purpose: ensure that a NetworkAttachmentDefinition (Multus NAD) exists in the given namespace with the given name and configuration pointing to the requested bridge.
    What it does:
        Attempts to Get the NAD as an unstructured.Unstructured (GVK k8s.cni.cncf.io/v1 NetworkAttachmentDefinition).
        If present: returns nil (no-op).
        If not found: builds an unstructured NAD object with a spec.config JSON that configures the bridge plugin and creates it with r.Create.
    Side-effects:
        Creates the NAD in the target namespace.
    Caveats / suggestions:
        The spec.config JSON is hard-coded. In production you may want the config to be configurable (IPAM options, subnets, gateway).
        The function does not set ownerReferences (NAD is namespaced while DCN is cluster-scoped, so ownerRef is not applicable); the controller must explicitly delete the NAD on DCN deletion (which it does).
        There's no validation of existing NAD content if it exists — it simply leaves it alone; you might choose to patch/replace if it differs.

ensureBridgeDaemonSet

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) ensureBridgeDaemonSet(ctx context.Context, bridge string) error
    Purpose: ensure a DaemonSet exists that runs on nodes and creates/maintains the host bridge interface with the requested name.
    What it does:
        Looks for a DaemonSet named "dummy-bridge-ensure" in namespace kube-system.
        If present: returns nil.
        If not present: constructs an apps/v1.DaemonSet object programmatically (Pod spec with hostNetwork, hostPID, privileged container running a script that ensures/creates the bridge) and creates it.
    Side-effects:
        Creates a privileged DaemonSet that will run on (almost) every node and ensure the bridge interface exists on each host.
    Caveats / suggestions:
        The function uses a single DaemonSet name for all bridges. That will not support multiple DCNs/bridges; better to include the bridge name in the DaemonSet name (with sanitization) so each DCN gets its own DaemonSet.
        The DaemonSet uses a full privileged container. For production, swap to a minimal vetted image, set resource requests/limits, and tighten securityContext where possible (e.g., drop unneeded capabilities).
        Consider Node selectors/tolerations to only run on compute nodes.
        The function treats any non-NotFound Get error as failure (good).
        It does not set an OwnerReference (because the DaemonSet is namespaced and the DCN is cluster-scoped). The controller tracks deletion explicitly.

deleteBridgeDaemonSet

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) deleteBridgeDaemonSet(ctx context.Context, bridge string) error
    Purpose: delete the DaemonSet created by ensureBridgeDaemonSet.
    What it does:
        Gets the DaemonSet "dummy-bridge-ensure" in kube-system; if not found returns nil; otherwise calls r.Delete(ds).
    Caveats:
        If multiple DCNs used the same DaemonSet name, deletion here could remove a DaemonSet still used by another network. Use unique per-bridge DaemonSet naming to avoid this.
        Does not wait for DaemonSet pods to terminate before continuing; that may be fine because deletion triggers pods to be removed, but you might want to ensure pod deletion completes before removing bridges from hosts.

deleteNAD

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) deleteNAD(ctx context.Context, namespace, name string) error
    Purpose: delete the NetworkAttachmentDefinition (if it exists).
    What it does:
        Gets the NAD unstructured; if not found returns nil; otherwise calls r.Delete(nad).
    Side-effects:
        Removes the NAD so Multus will no longer be available for new attachments.
    Caveats:
        Existing VMs that still reference the NAD might show errors after deletion; the Reconcile ensures the NAD is deleted only when no VM/VMI references it.

isNetworkInUse

    Signature: func (r *DummyClusterNetworkReconciler) isNetworkInUse(ctx context.Context, fullName, shortName string) (bool, []string, error)
    Purpose: determine whether any VirtualMachine or VirtualMachineInstance is currently configured to use the NAD (either as namespace/name or just name).
    What it does:
        Lists all VirtualMachine objects (unstructured VirtualMachineList) and checks each with objectUsesNetwork. If uses → append a description to users list.
        Lists all VirtualMachineInstance objects and does the same.
        Returns (len(users) > 0), users, err
    Side-effects:
        None besides reading lists of VM and VMI objects.
    Caveats:
        This does a full-list of both VMs and VMIs across the cluster each deletion check. On large clusters this might be heavy; alternatives:
            Use field/indexed cache queries (index the networks field) or
            Watch VMs/VMIs and maintain a cache or use informer indexers via typed client for efficient lookup.
        If the kubevirt API is not installed, r.List may error. The code currently returns that error upstream (which will cause Reconcile to requeue). You might prefer to treat missing API as "not in use" in some environments.

objectUsesNetwork

    Signature: func objectUsesNetwork(obj *unstructured.Unstructured, fullName, shortName string) (bool, error)
    Purpose: check whether a given unstructured VM/VMI object references the NAD either in:
        spec.template.spec.networks[*].multus.networkName
        or in spec.template.metadata.annotations["k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks"] (legacy Multus annotation)
    What it does:
        Reads spec.template.spec.networks (if present) and inspects each element for a multus.networkName string. Compares exact equality or suffix match (/shortName).
        Reads the annotation and splits the comma-separated list and compares each entry similarly.
    Caveats:
        The function assumes the Multus annotation exists under spec.template.metadata.annotations; some VMs may use different annotation locations — it covers the common cases.
        It ignores errors from NestedString calls in places (similar to earlier discussion). Better to propagate/handle errors explicitly.
        The check compares both fullName (namespace/name) and shortName; it also checks suffix matches to handle entries like "namespace/netname".
        For some KubeVirt manifests, Multus networks might be specified differently; validate against your KubeVirt version/config.

ptrBool

    Signature: func ptrBool(b bool) *bool
    Purpose: small helper that returns pointer to a bool literal (used when constructing SecurityContext.Privileged pointer).
    Behavior: returns &b
    Note: trivial helper, common pattern in Go code that builds API objects.

containsString, removeString

    Purpose: utilities to check if a slice contains a given string and to remove a string from a slice (used to manage finalizers).
    Behavior:
        containsString returns true if s equals any element.
        removeString returns a new slice excluding any elements equal to s (keeps original order).
    Notes:
        removeString allocates a new slice; fine for small finalizer lists.

newHostPathType

    Signature: func newHostPathType(t corev1.HostPathType) *corev1.HostPathType
    Purpose: returns a pointer to a HostPathType value (used when constructing HostPathVolumeSource.Type).
    Behavior: returns &t (similar pattern to ptrBool)

RBAC annotations (comments)

    Purpose: Provide kubebuilder-style comments that tools can parse to generate RBAC manifests (and also document what API groups/resources the controller needs).
    They indicate the controller requires permissions for:
        dummyclusternetworks (network.harvester.io)
        network-attachment-definitions (k8s.cni.cncf.io)
        daemonsets (apps)
        pods (core)
        virtualmachines/virtualmachineinstances (kubevirt.io)

Some suggestions/improvements

    Error handling for field extraction: Do not ignore the found and error return values from unstructured.NestedString. Check errors and handle the missing-field case explicitly.
    Unique resource naming: If you plan to support multiple DummyClusterNetwork objects simultaneously, make the DaemonSet and any other cluster-scoped artifacts unique per DCN (for example: dummy-bridge-ensure-<sanitized-bridge-name>).
    Watches & events: Add Watches on NAD and DaemonSet (and optionally on VMs/VMIs) so the controller reconciles when related resources change. That avoids fixed-interval requeues.
    Performance: Listing all VMs and VMIs on every deletion attempt may become expensive on large clusters. Consider informer indexers or caching strategies or using the API server fieldSelectors where applicable.
    Owner references: Since DCN is cluster-scoped and NAD is namespaced, ownerRef cannot directly be used. The finalizer approach is correct; just be careful to ensure the controller is highly available so finalizers are cleaned up when appropriate.
    Concurrency & idempotency: Ensure multiple concurrent reconcile loops (for updates) behave well. The code is mostly idempotent, but be careful when creating resources with static names.
    Events & logging: Emit Kubernetes events describing blocking VMs when deletion is blocked — helps operators understand what to do.
    Tests: Add unit tests for objectUsesNetwork and integration tests for the Reconcile flow (especially deletion blocking).
